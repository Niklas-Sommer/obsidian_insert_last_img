# Insert Last Image Plugin
This plugin is just an editor command that inserts the latest image in a folder at the current cursor position. The user can specifiy a hotkey for even faster insertion.

# Use cases:
I personally use it to speed up my continuity camera workflow on MAC. I just import a picture into the Images folder using continuity camera and then press the hotkey in obsidian and it is in my file!
